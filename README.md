Jaguar Electronic Parts Catalog ETL Code in R

Current Work in Progress to extract data from the Jaguar Electronic Parts Catalog (EPC) for use in our own internal content management system and point of sale software.  Due to our software's limitation in bulk image uploading, the goal of the current part of the project is to extract data for each part that references the location in the Jaguar EPC for ease of lookup and part identification.
